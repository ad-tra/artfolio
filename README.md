Welcome to my collection of childhood artworks! This portfolio was initially created for college applications as it represents a journey through time, patience, and the growth of my artistic craftsmanship.
These pieces not only reflect my artistic development but also provide a glimpse into a world of art that I've cherished during my childhood.
